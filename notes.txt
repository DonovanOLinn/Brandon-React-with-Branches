So, then hosting on Netlify (which you will do in the last video), the BrowserRouter doesn't like to work. So I would recommend switching to 
HashRouter when it gets to that point. 
Also, make sure that your react router dom is at least in version 6. If you are having any issues with it, then please uninstall your version
and install the version that I have here. To do that, simply do:
npm uninstall react-router-dom
npm install react-router-dom@6.11.2

So something that has come up during this, is that @mui/x-data-grid has recently gone up in version. Due to this, instead of installing the version
that Brandon uses, it installs a newer one where the parameters you set up don't exist. 

To fix this, simply do:
npm uninstall @mui/x-data-grid

Then do:
npm install @mui/x-data-grid@5.17.24
